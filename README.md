This repository will contain the "Hello-World" file.
My name is Thanit Mitparien. I am originally from Thailand but I have been living in the United States for 14 years now. I am currently working for PACCAR Embbedded Engineering as a Hardware Engineer. At the moment, I have been trying to learn how to program an embbeded system because I eventually want a job in this field.
